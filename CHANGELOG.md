Initial release, adds **many** keybindings from Eclipse on Windows and PyDev. 

The idea behind the keybindings is making it as similar as possible to Eclipse on Windows with some customizations from PyDev.

-- Note that the bindings used are the ones from Eclipse on Windows even on different platforms.
